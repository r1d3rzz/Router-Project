## Installation

Firstly you need to create mysql database

```bash
  create database todo;
  use todo;
  create table tasks (id int primary key auto_increment,description varchar(120) not null,complete boolean not null);
  create table users (id int primary key auto_increment,names varchar(120) not null);
```
And than you also need to insert into table 
 
 ```bash
    insert into tasks (description,complete) values ("finish homework",0),("go to the store",1);
    insert into users (names) values ("[you can set any names]");
 ```
